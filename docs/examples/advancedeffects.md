# AdvancedEffects examples

*AdvancedEffects* is a React application that shows more advanced `gl-react-dom` samples.

It performs non trivial animated effects that still runs at 60 FPS on a iPhone.

It is implemented both in React and React Native:

- [gl-react-dom `Examples/AdvancedEffects`](https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react-dom/tree/master/Examples/AdvancedEffects)
- [gl-react-native `Examples/AdvancedEffects`](https://github.com/ProjectSeptemberInc/gl-react-native/tree/master/Examples/AdvancedEffects)
